# RedditPowermodAnalysis
Reddit is a discussion board website where registered users can
submit content such as images, text, links, and videos. While users
can upvote or downvote content they like and dislike, there are
also moderators that are given extra authority to help uphold the
communities’ guidelines. The primary focus of our project will
be uncovering the moderation network of Reddit. Moderators are
given extra authority that grants them the ability to remove posts or
comments, ban members who may be spammers or are breaking the
community rules, and add other members as moderators. The work
done by Reddit moderators is volunteer and as stated by J. Nathan
Matias, “Scholarship on volunteer moderation has tended to view
this work as digital labor, civic participation, or oligarchy” (2016).
We looked through the major subreddits of Reddit and analyzed
the information we found to try and understand the moderator
network of Reddit.
This type of information can be valuable in determining infor-
mation regarding Power Mods. “Power Mods” are moderators who
moderate a very large amount of subreddits and users (Auror An-
drachrome, 2022). Power Mods are often looked on poorly because
of their ability to control such a large number of members and
direct the conversations being held. We are not trying to determine
whether or not they are negatively affecting Reddit but rather iden-
tify the reach that these power mods have. We will also be able
to identify who the major players are and how big the network
of Reddit is. To build on this, we also investigate two properties
of a moderator, their influence, and their power. The influence of
a moderator is more shallow-focused and determines how many
users a moderator moderates. The power of a moderator focuses
instead on how much of their influence they are exerting. Due to
the availability of certain moderation actions, we focus only on the
removal of posts to subreddits they moderate, as banned users are
not publicly available in almost all cases.
Our biggest question in this research is determining if there are
specific moderators who fall under the category of “Power Mods”.
Are there moderators who have a significantly large influence com-
pared to the average moderator? The user we found who had the
most overall influence, Blank-Cheque, had around 293 million in-
fluence and stated "When I was really into it i would do, as i said,
literally over a thousand mod actions a day and clear dozens of
queues." This is a motivating idea to see what the influence of the
average moderator looks like, as well as identifying other power
moderators. Are there moderators who exert a lot of power within
the subreddits they moderate? There are some other interesting
things to look at when it comes to moderation on Reddit however,
such as how many moderators the largest subreddits have and how
many subreddits are moderated by those moderators. Understand-
ing moderation on Reddit overall can be extended to other areas
such as the average amount of moderators per subreddit and how
it changes based on size.
We found that that the subreddits with the largest communities
have the most moderators on average. This aligns with our expec-
tations as subreddits with more users will need more moderation.
We also found that moderators in the top 100 subreddits moderate
significantly more communities than those top 1000. This shows
that moderators on Reddit have reputations and moderating on one
top community increases their chances to moderate on another.
